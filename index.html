    "Visualize walking down a favorite path—a memory or a dream place. The colors are vivid, the path is easy, and there is no hurry. Notice the details: the texture of the ground, the scent in the air, the warmth of the sun on your skin. This place is your sanctuary, and you can return anytime you need rest.",
    // --- New Scripts Added Below ---

    // 4. Christian - Shepherd
    "**Christian Theme:** Imagine yourself as a sheep resting in a vast, green pasture. The **Good Shepherd** is near, watching over you with complete care and unconditional love. Hear His gentle voice calling your name. Feel the deep assurance that you lack nothing, that you are perfectly safe under His protection. Rest in His peace.",

    // 5. General - Mountain top
    "Visualize yourself at the very top of a peaceful, snow-capped mountain. Below you, all your concerns look small and distant. Feel the crisp, clean air fill your lungs.

Be filled with its grace.",

    // 10. General - Forest clearing
    "You are standing in a small, sun-drenched clearing in an old forest. The tall trees form a natural cathedral around you, holding a quiet sacredness. There is a comfortable seat or patch of soft moss awaiting you. Sit down, lean back, and allow the profound, ancient energy of the earth to hold you and calm your nervous system.",

    // 11. General - Sky as mind
    "Imagine your mind is the vast, open sky. Thoughts are like clouds passing by—some are dark, some are light, but none of them are the sky itself. Simply watch them drift by without judgment or attachment. The sky remains immense, eternal, and perfectly clear. Rest in the vast, unchanging stillness of your inner sky.",

    // 12. Christian - Worn smooth stone
    "**Christian Theme:** Hold a smooth, worn stone in your mind. This stone represents a worry or a sin you want to release. Now, visualize placing this stone directly at the foot of the **Cross**. Let go of the need to carry it. As you turn and walk away, feel the immediate lightness and freedom of complete forgiveness and redemption.",

    // 13. General - Breathing color
    "Breathe in the deepest, calmest shade of blue you can imagine—a color that relaxes every muscle. As you exhale, breathe out a smoky, dull color, carrying away stress. Inhale the peaceful blue, filling your lungs and spreading through your chest. Exhale the tension. Continue until you feel saturated in calm, clear blue.",

    // 14. General - Floating

Feel the belt of truth tightening around you, the breastplate of righteousness protecting your heart, and the helmet of salvation guarding your mind. You are completely prepared, protected, and standing firm in faith.",

    // 16. General - Healing hands
    "Place your hands wherever you feel tension or discomfort in your body. Imagine that the warmth in your hands is a healing energy, a golden warmth that soothes and repairs. Breathe in, sending this golden warmth deeper. Breathe out, releasing any pain or stiffness. Your touch is healing and restorative.",

    // 17. General - Open door
    "Visualize a door standing open, leading to a beautiful, sunlit garden. This door represents a new beginning or a positive change. Take a deep, confident step through the doorway. Feel the welcoming warmth and scent of blossoms. You are entering a new space filled with possibility, hope, and light.",

    // 18. Christian - Table prepared
    "**Christian Theme:** Visualize yourself seated at a beautiful table in a quiet, safe place, prepared just for you by the Lord. This table is an image of blessing, abundance, and provision, even in the presence of struggle. Accept the gifts of peace and nourishment offered to you. You are cared for and honored.",

    // 19. General - Roots
    "Imagine you are a magnificent tree, sending strong, deep roots down into the solid earth. Feel those roots anchoring you, making you stable and unmovable. No matter what winds blow above, you are connected to the deep, supportive strength of the ground. Feel your resilience and inner stillness.",

    // 20. Christian - Peace that surpasses
    "**Christian Theme:** Focus on the deepest center of your heart. Breathe in the **peace of God that surpasses all understanding** (Philippians 4:7). Imagine this peace as a calm, radiant energy that settles your emotions and stills your thoughts. It is a gift given freely, and it guards your heart and mind completely.",

    // 21. General - Golden ball of energy
    "Picture a small, pulsing golden ball of energy hovering above your head. With your next inhale, draw that golden energy down into the crown of your head. Feel it slowly melt down your neck, relaxing your throat and shoulders. Continue breathing, letting the light fill and heal every cell until it reaches your toes.",

    // 22. General - Safe haven
    "You are in your ultimate safe haven—a place where you are completely loved and accepted exactly as you are. There are no demands, no expectations, only comfort and quiet companionship. Sink deeply into the feeling of absolute safety and belonging. You are home now."
